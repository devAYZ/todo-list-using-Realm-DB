# Week 9 SQ006 Task

## TODO LIST MVVM

> Implementation of a TodoList Management App with data persistence using the MVVM design pattern


## Introduction

This week takes on the task to ensure the understanding of Data Persistence in iOS Swift.

While there are about 4 ways to achieving this in iOS with Swift,
our main focus is going to be on using Realm and perhaps, Firebase.

## Task

The task is to replicate the designs provided my the UI Team for our awesome app,
named: **MVVM Todo List**

Just as the name suggests, the app should be reproduce with the designs using the MVVM Design Pattern.

### User Xperience

One of the major factors reported to have influenced users frequent use of an app or service
is the experience with the app.

Ensure (not optional) to give users enough feedback and always remember never to trust user actions on your app.

## Data Persistence

Use ![Realm](https://realm.io/) for persisting data in this project. You can read more about the mobile database, 
you can get started with Realm for iOS and other Apple platforms ![here](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/ios/install/)

Cheers!
